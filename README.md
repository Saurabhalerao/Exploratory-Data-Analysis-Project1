Exploratory Data Analysis

This is my repository for the Coursera's course "Exploratory Data Analysis". 
Our overall goal here is simply to examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007.

Currently there are 8 files for the Course Project 1: 4 png pictures and 4 scripts to generate each png pictures.

To run this script you need to do the following:

Download the scripts (plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R, plot4.R) to some directory;
Download the data from here: This assignment uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, 
                             a popular repository for machine learning datasets. In particular, 
                             we will be using the “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set”

Extract the data into ./Data subdirectory;
Run the scripts & all plots will be saved into current directory.
